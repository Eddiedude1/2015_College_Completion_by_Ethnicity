# Project 4 - Choose your own adventure

Due Date: November 29, 2017

As you progress through the course, the projects are going to give way to working on your capstone. In preparation for this transition, each instructor has chosen a dataset for you to simply play around with and explore.

From those three datasets, **you'll choose one** that is of interest to you. Use the skills you've learned up to this point (EDA, machine learning, etc), and see what you can come up with.

Unlike the previous projects, this one is intentionally left open-ended; there are no specific questions for you to answer and no set path that you have to follow. We're excited to see where your curiosity takes you.

Here are the three datasets:

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

For all projects, students will be evaluated on a simple 4 point scale (0-3 inclusive). Instructors will use this rubric when scoring student performance on each of the core project requirements:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations. Try again._
**1** | _Approaching expectations. Getting there..._
**2** | _Meets expecations. Great job._
**3** | _Surpasses expectations. Brilliant!_

For Project 4 the evaluation categories are as follows:

- **Organization**:	Clearly commented, annotated and sectioned Jupyter notebook or Python script. Comments and annotations add clarity, explanation and intent to the work. Notebook is well-structured with title, author and sections. Assumptions are stated and justified.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: A thorough exploratory data analysis has been conducted. Descriptive statistics, univariate and bivariate analysis, and plotting are skillfully used to explore connections across the dataset between features and targets.
- **Modeling Process**: Skillful and correct use of cross-validation, grid search, and goodness-of-fit metrics to evaluate candidate models. Assumptions and decisions in the modeling process are stated and justified. Use of correct modeling techniques in each challenge. Data is reproducibly and reliably transformed between training and test datasets.

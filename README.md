# Project 5 - Choose your own adventure

**Due Date: March 26, 2017**

As you progress through the course, the projects are going to give way to working on your capstone. In preparation for this transition, we haven chosen two datasets for you to simply play around with and explore.

From these two datasets, **you'll choose one** that is of interest to you. Use the skills you've learned up to this point (EDA, machine learning, etc), and see what you can come up with.

Unlike the previous projects, this one is intentionally left open-ended; there are no specific questions for you to answer and no set path that you have to follow. We're excited to see where your curiosity takes you.

Here are the two datasets:

## Option 1
For this project you will assemble a dataset for investigating colleges and universities.  Fortunately, there is a large collection of higher education data from the government that is accessible through an API.  This service provides tons of data, from cost statistics to admission rates to instructional expenditures!

The data spans a number of years and categories, so simply deciding what data you want to look at and how you want to analyze will take some time.

A successful project will pull down data, perform thorough EDA and build *at least* one model.  (What you model is up to you, and remember that models can be predictive *or* inferential!).  You could also look at the possibility of clustering to identify different types of schools.

> **Pro tip:** The rate limit is quite high for the API service, but it is still a good idea to cache your data to local file once you have retrieved it.  This allows you to reload your data faster and work offline, not to mention just playing "nice" with the API service.

The main data documentation is available at [https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/). This page includes a detailed data dictionary as well as a couple of reports describing the data.  That page also links to the specific [API documentation](https://github.com/RTICWDT/open-data-maker/blob/master/API.md).

To use the API you will need to signup for a (free) API key on [https://api.data.gov/docs/](https://api.data.gov/docs/).  This page also includes links describing [API key usage](https://api.data.gov/docs/api-key/) and [rate limits](https://api.data.gov/docs/rate-limits/).

## Option 2
If you're a fan of March Madness, this is the dataset for you! Every year, Kaggle hosts their a March Madness competition, wherein you build a model to predict the winner of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Last year, one of our West Coast instructors (Riley) I finished in a respectable 57th place!

The data you'll be using is current through last year's season.

> **WARNING**: When predicting the outcome of a game, you can use stats that occur up to **but not including** that particular game.

# Project Feedback + Evaluation

Data science is a field in which we apply data to solve real-world problems. Therefore, projects and presentations are means by which we can assess your ability to solve real-world problems in a data-driven manner.

Your final assessment ("grade," if you will) will be calculated based on a [topical rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19k8OZ42xzr7v9GDv2IUyD175yGjJlwTNokcufwX9Ago/edit?usp=sharing). For each category, you will receive a score of 0-3. From the rubric you can see descriptions of each score and what is needed to attain those scores. Make sure you look at the "Rubric P5" tab of the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19k8OZ42xzr7v9GDv2IUyD175yGjJlwTNokcufwX9Ago/edit?usp=sharing).
